The majority of wired gadgets in our environment today are transitioning to wireless. Our research involves the simulation modelling of a Smart Farm, a wireless gadget that is utilized in agricultural fields to monitor farm conditions. The most often measured and monitored basic conditions are soil moisture and water availability, and this data is regarded as the most important source of knowledge for crop selection and development. To make the best use of the water supply for agricultural crops, the water irrigation system was developed. This project was created to develop a water irrigation system using an Arduino microcontroller board. Irrigation is challenging in areas with little rain or when there isn't enough rain. Automation is required to ensure proper water delivery while saving farmerâ€™s time and labour. This approach is highly helpful if farmers aren't available to irrigate their fields on a regular basis . Therefore, effective water management is crucial in irrigated agricultural systems.
