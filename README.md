ABSTRACT

The majority of wired gadgets in our environment today are transitioning to wireless. Our research involves the simulation modelling of a Smart Farm, a wireless gadget that is utilized in agricultural fields to monitor farm conditions. The most often measured and monitored basic conditions are soil moisture and water availability, and this data is regarded as the most important source of knowledge for crop selection and development. To make the best use of the water supply for agricultural crops, the water irrigation system was developed. This project was created to develop a water irrigation system using an Arduino microcontroller board. Irrigation is challenging in areas with little rain or when there isn't enough rain. Automation is required to ensure proper water delivery while saving farmer’s time and labour. This approach is highly helpful if farmers aren't available to irrigate their fields on a regular basis . Therefore, effective water management is crucial in irrigated agricultural systems.

INTRODUCTION

Agriculture is reliant on rainfall, which is insufficient for irrigation of all agricultural crops. The irrigation system aids in providing water to fields based on the soil's moisture content. Irrigation depends heavily on rain. The need for water supply stems from the fact that most fields depend on rainfall. In the conventional system, the farmer must work carefully and take complete care of the water supply in order to water the crops, which depends on the type of crops. Plants become ruined by insufficient irrigation. The water irrigation system will be most helpful for proper irrigation since it will supply the right amount of water for each region, prevent water from overflowing in puddled regions, and take farmer's needs into account. The main factor to consider in a cropping system is a proper water supply system. Reduced water uses for agricultural crops, a process that is crucial, is achieved through the use of irrigation. A pre-vial over- and under-irrigation system is required for water irrigation. Over irrigation happens as a result of improper water and chemical distribution, which contributed to water pollution. Under irrigation, the soil becomes more salinized and hazardous salts accumulate on the soil surface in areas with significant evaporation. Smart irrigation systems have been utilized to solve these issues and reduce the amount of labour required. The irrigation system, which delivers little amounts of water to the plant's root systems, has been updated to overcome these limitations. By regularly giving the right amount of water resources, it is possible to treat plant soil moisture stress and maintain healthier growth. The overall concept of a water irrigation system uses half as much water as conventional sprinkler or surface watering methods. Water can be given to plants in even more precise amounts.
